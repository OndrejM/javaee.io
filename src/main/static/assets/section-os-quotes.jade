                TomEE is really a really value added to our team. We started to play with OpenEJB and Tomcat a
                couple of years ago and in 2012, TomEE, became our reference application server. Community support
                is amazing! Keep up the good work!.

                Running TomEE embedded with Hibernate and PrimeFaces+Apache TomEE  is perhaps one of the best, leanest
                implementations of Java EE 6, with Java EE 7 on the horizon.
